        <h2>Battle</h2>

        <img src="./img/image_battle.png" width="640" height="400" />

        <p>This is the battle scene to play combat with enemies.</p>

        <p>On the left side, there is your character. And on the right side, there are enemies.</p>

        <p>The battle is turn-based. At your turn, you draw 5 cards from your hand pile and you can use cards to make actions.</p>

        <p>To use cards, you must drag and drop on the target enemy (if you selected an attack card) or your character (if you selected a block or heal card).</p>

        <p>The used card is stacked to the discard pile (to be recycled to your hand pile) or the exhaust pile (never recycled in this combat).</p>

        <p>When you use a card, your action point is consumed (required point is shown in the card). You can use any cards as long as you have action points.</p>

        <p>After you pressed "Turn End" button, the enemy turn begins. The enemies do actions indicated with the icons above. You should prepare for their actions in advance.</p>

        <p>The key point of the battle is to utilize status effects. Status effects is shown with icons below of characters.</p>

        <img src="./img/image_status_effect.png" />

        <ul>
            <li>Block: Block damages.</li>
            <li>Strength: Increase attack power.</li>
            <li>Dexterity: Increase block amount.</li>
            <li>Regeneration: Heal health per turn. Decrease per turn.</li>
            <li>Armor Shard: Gain block per turn. Decrease per turn.</li>
            <li>Poison: Take damages per turn, ignoring block. Decrease per turn.</li>
            <li>Stun: You can't do any action (the turn is skipped.)</li>
            <li>Frail: Your attack power is halved. Decrease per attack.</li>
            <li>Vulnerable: Your taken damage is doubled. Decrease per damage.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If the enemy's health is below zero, the enemy is defeated. Then you can get some coins (doubled if you defeated the enemy with just zero health [<em>Just Strike!</em>]).</p>

        <p>If your character's health is below zero, the game is over. You are returned to home scene.</p>

        <img src="./img/image_reward.png" width="640" height="400" />

        <p>If you win the combat, you can get rewards.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Cards (choices are selected randomly)</li>
            <li>Coins (doubled at the end of boss battle)</li>
            <li>Diamonds (only at the end of boss battle)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>After you acquired rewards, you will proceed to next encounter of this stage or next stage if you defeated the stage boss.</p>

        <p>There are 4 stages in this game. At stage 4-4, there is a final boss. Can you defeat the powerful boss and end your journey?</p>
